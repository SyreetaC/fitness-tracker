# Fitness Tracker

## Description

This fitness tracker allows the user to create a workout where they input information about the exercise they have begun. The data can then be analyzed and presented in a stats page that provides insights into the details of all their workouts. Users can continue a workout by inputting further information about the exercise they have undertaken. The backend of the application was built using MongoDB, Mongoose and Express.
